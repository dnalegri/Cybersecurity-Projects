# SIEM and NIDS Projects

This repository documents my project on setting up and configuring Wazuh as a SIEM/XDR solution, integrating VirusTotal for malware detection and removal, and using Suricata as a NIDS. The setup involves deploying the Wazuh manager on an Ubuntu desktop and the Wazuh agent on a Kali Linux machine, with Suricata installed on the Kali Linux machine for network intrusion detection.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to implement a comprehensive security monitoring solution using Wazuh and Suricata. By integrating these tools, the project aims to achieve real-time threat detection, log analysis, and active response capabilities to enhance the overall security posture of the network.

## Skills Learned

- Deployment and configuration of Wazuh manager and agent.
- Integration of VirusTotal API for malware analysis and removal.
- Setup and configuration of Suricata as a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS).
- Customization of Suricata rules and integration with Wazuh for enhanced threat detection.
- Creation and implementation of active response scripts for automated threat remediation.
- Visualization and analysis of security alerts using the Wazuh dashboard.
