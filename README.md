# Technical Projects Documentation

This repository serves as a comprehensive documentation of my technical projects. Within these repositories, you will find detailed write-ups that demonstrate my practical work using home labs and various tools and technologies. The projects encompass a range of topics including:

- **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**: Implementation and management within cloud environments such as Azure and AWS, as well as Windows Server.
- **Python Scripting**: Automation scripts for diverse tasks including data manipulation, system administration, and network operations.
- **Network Analysis and Sniffing**: Tools and techniques used to monitor, analyze, and secure network traffic.
- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**: Deployment and usage of SIEM tools to enhance security posture through real-time analysis of security alerts.

Each project is documented to provide insights into the methodologies, tools, and techniques employed, showcasing both the process and outcomes of my technical endeavors.

As I continue on my security journey, this page will be continually updated.
