# Overview
These projects aim to use the VirusTotal API to scan file hashes and urls using python, automating the process of analysis. More features are available using the Premium API but for these projects I will be using the Public API.

## Documentation
The VirusTotal API documentation can be found here as well as the vt-py module:
